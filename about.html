            <h2>What is the music therapy?</h2>
            <p>
                Music therapy is an evidence-based therapeutic approach that use music and music 
                experiences to enhance the independence and quality of life for individuals with 
                developmental and psychosocial needs. Music therapy benefits a wide range of populations, 
                but for children and adolescents, it specifically aims to develop and enhance skills across physical, cognitive, language, social, and emotional domains. 
                This process enables individuals in their developmental stages to maximize their potential abilities and adapt harmoniously to their environments, including home, school, and community. 
                Grounded in scientific evidence, music therapy programs are tailored to meet each individual’s unique needs, systematically incorporating musical elements and fostering a therapist-client relationship that promotes growth.

            <h2>About our music therapy training and education</h2>
            <p>
                The SCHS-EWHA Music Therapy Training and Education Program equips local educators and professionals in Sharjah and the broader Arab region with specialized music therapy skills. 
                Launched in 2013 in collaboration with Ewha Woman’s University in South Korea, the program enables participants to integrate music therapy into their fields, offering children and adolescents at SCHS more comprehensive and professional support. 
                The curriculum combines theoretical knowledge with practical training, enhancing trainees' abilities to design and implement music-based interventions and integrate music into other therapeutic approaches. Additionally, the program fosters research competencies, empowering participants to manage music therapy programs systematically and provide empirical evidence of their effectiveness.
                To date, over 140 SCHS staff members have completed the program, and 38 female specialists have graduated from Ewha University. Their work has positively impacted more than 1,400 students with various disabilities, enhancing their social, linguistic, psychological, behavioral, perceptual, motor, and cognitive skills

            <p>
                
                Since 2013, our partnership with Ewha has grown through a shared vision and strong commitment. We have collaborated closely in music therapy services, teacher training, and research. Starting with the first music therapy workshop in 2014, we have co-hosted annual workshops, with Ewha’s interns and supervisors providing therapy services to children at SCHS.
                We’ve also conducted teacher training programs, awarding certificates to participants who completed the required training and clinical hours under Ewha’s supervision. Additionally, we’ve co-organized international conferences and launched ongoing research initiatives to support the impact of music therapy with empirical evidence. Key findings are regularly shared through case presentations.
                Outcomes and insights have been shared through regular case presentations.<br>

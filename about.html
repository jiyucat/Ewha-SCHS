            <h2>What is the music therapy?</h2>
            <p>
                Music therapy is an evidence-based therapeutic approach that use music and music 
                experiences to enhance the independence and quality of life for individuals with 
                developmental and psychosocial needs. Music therapy benefits a wide range of populations, 
                but for children and adolescents, it specifically aims to develop and enhance skills across physical, cognitive, language, social, and emotional domains. 
                This process enables individuals in their developmental stages to maximize their potential abilities and adapt harmoniously to their environments, including home, school, and community. 
                Grounded in scientific evidence, music therapy programs are tailored to meet each individual’s unique needs, systematically incorporating musical elements and fostering a therapist-client relationship that promotes growth.
